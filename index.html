    <p>Jesus loves me! This I know,<br>
        For the Bible tells me so;<br>
        Little ones to Him belong;<br>
        They are weak, but He is strong.</p>
        
        <p>Refrain:</p>
        
        <p>Yes, Jesus loves me!<br>
        Yes, Jesus loves me!<br>
        Yes, Jesus loves me!<br>
        The Bible tells me so.</p>
        
        <p>Jesus loves me! This I know,<br>
        As He loved so long ago,<br>
        Taking children on His knee,<br>
        Saying, “Let them come to Me.”</p>
        
        <p>Jesus loves me still today,<br>
        Walking with me on my way,<br>
        Wanting as a friend to give<br>
        Light and love to all who live.</p>
        
        <p>Jesus loves me! He who died<br>
        Heaven’s gate to open wide;<br>
        He will wash away my sin,<br>
        Let His little child come in.</p>
        
        <p>Jesus loves me! He will stay<br>
        Close beside me all the way;<br>
        Thou hast bled and died for me,<br>
        I will henceforth live for Thee.</p>
